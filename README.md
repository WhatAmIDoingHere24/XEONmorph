# XEONmorph
I have seen very few peolple making homebrew computers wioth a 64-bit CPU. Throughout this journy i will be attemping to build a 6502 computer roughly based on ben eaters but out of an 2004 Intel Xeon Proccesor. I want to do this just for the fun of it and be part of the few who have (at least) tried something  like this!
