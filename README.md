# XEONmorph
I have seen only a small handfull of peolple on the internet try and build a HoeBrew 64-bit computer. Now there are some amazing videos out there of peolple builing 64-bit proccesors but not full systems like Ben Eaters. I plan on following the ideas and rough builds of ben eater for this series becuase he was both the inspiration and where i came up with the idea for this project. I will be using an '2004 Intel Xeon 3.4' proccesor to do all the hard work. If this project actually gets off the ground i want to expand into using two of these chips to work in tandem (ill explain later). So throughout this project i will write in this README the progress of this project, I also want to explain a lot of major parts of computing and how this chip does some really cool stuff. So follow me on this project as i try and build my FIRST homebrew computer, attempt to explain all of this and hopefully inspire some others along the way!

So of course before we can even begin this project i have to
